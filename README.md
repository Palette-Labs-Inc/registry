## About the Network Registry Infrastructure
We are designing a federated, server-to-server architecture for commercial markets. The design supports an interoperable network of independently hosted `Provider Supporting Servers` and `Buyer Supporting Servers` that are responsible for onboarding participants on either side of the network.

The network registry is a decentralized public ledger that maintains the records of Node Operators (network servers), agents, their supported Industry Codes, and the geographical regions that they represent. The registry is queried for a Producers products or services during the search phase of a Buyers transaction lifecycle. 

During registration into the network, a Node Operator creates an ethereum key pair. The public key is stored on the blockchain in the network registry along with a unique identifier. When communicating with other Node's in the network, a *sending* Node Operator signs the data that they are sending over the network, including the signature hash in the header of the HTTP request. When this message is received by a *receiving* Node, they should query the registry for the *sending* Node's public key and use the signature in the request header to decrypt the message. If the message is successfully decrypted, the *receiving* Node Operator can know that the *sending* Node Operator is VERIFIED and properly registered. If the *sending* Node Operator's message is unable to be decrypted, the *receiving* Node Operator should respond to the *sending* Node Operators request with an error code. 

All registered Node Operators self-maintain a `location` field in the registry table. The location field supports an array of strings that represent a [`Hexagonal Hierarchical Spatial Index`](https://github.com/uber/h3).

#### Instructions

In order to audit the test coverage of the full test suite, run:

```sh
yarn test:coverage
```

## Profiling

You can profile the gas costs of all of the user-focused flows via:

```sh
yarn test:profile
```

## Deploying

The contracts have built-in support for deployments on different chains and mainnet forks. You can deploy the project by:

```sh
yarn deploy
```

The framework was inspired and adopted from [EAS](https://github.com/ethereum-attestation-service/eas-contracts/).
