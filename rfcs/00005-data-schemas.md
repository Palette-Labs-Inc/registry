## Abstract

## Motivation
Our motivation for a schema definition language is largely the same as the [raw IPLD Schema motivation](https://ipld.io/docs/schemas/#motivation). A standard for the networks data will make coordinating groups of developers and their applications much easier. IPLD Schemas have rich support for describing immutable document graphs based on [content-addressable](https://ipld.io/glossary/#content-addressing) [linking](https://ipld.io/glossary/#link) in distributed systems.  

## Proposal

## Examples

(Optional) If applicable, provide details about the implementation of the proposal, including any prototypes, code snippets, or reference implementations.

## References

List any references such as existing RFCs, standards documents, or academic papers that were cited or used in the creation of this RFC.
