## Abstract
An RDSID (Reverse Domain Schema Identifiers) with a fully-qualified hostname in reverse domain-name order follows a specific structure to organize and identify entities within a hierarchical namespace,

## Motivation
RDSIDs give developers convenient classifications to structure [requests](./00010-remote-procedure-calls.md) and [data models](./00004-data-models.md).

## Introduction
The RDSID structure can be broken down into its component parts using the format:

```shell
{tld}.{domain}.{name}
```
Where:
- **{tld}**: Top-Level Domain, such as `com`, `org`, `xyz`, or a country code like `uk`, `us`, etc.
- **{domain}**: The second-level domain, which is typically the name of the organization, company, or service.
- **{name}**: the name segment used to reference a [NSDL](./00005-schema-definition-language.md) schema for records, or XRPC endpoints.

- **Overall RDSID Requirements**:
    - It should only include ASCII characters.
    - The domain authority and the name are to be divided by a period (`.`) in ASCII format.
    - minimum of three parts.
    - The total character count should not exceed 317.
- **Domain Authority Specifications**:
    - Individual parts must hold between 1 to 63 characters, excluding periods.
    - ASCII alphabets (`a-z`), numbers (`0-9`), and the hyphen (`-`).
    - Parts cannot commence with or conclude with a hyphen.
    - The initial part (the top-level domain) cannot begin with a number.
    - Insensitive to case variations, the domain authority ought to be uniformly presented in lowercase, converting ASCII `A-Z` to `a-z`.
    - The total length, periods included, should not surpass 253 characters, maintaining a requirement for at least two parts.
- **Name Criteria**:
    - Numbers and hyphens are prohibited.
    - case sensitive and must not be normalized.
    - The character count must range from 1 to 63.
    - Only ASCII alphabetic characters (`A-Z`, `a-z`) are allowed.

### RDSID Syntax Enhancements
An **element** can be attached to an RDSID in specific situations to pinpoint a particular subsection within the schema. This element is delineated from the RDSID using an ASCII hash character (`#`). The element identifier (following the `#`) adheres to the same syntactical constraints as the RDSID's terminal segment: it must be composed of ASCII alphabetic characters, encompass one or more characters, and adhere to length limitations, among others.

For addressing a collection or a specific pattern of RDSIDs, an ending ASCII asterisk character (`*`) may serve as a wildcard symbol. For instance, `xyz.nosh.*` signifies any RDSIDs within the `nosh.xyz` domain authority scope, inclusive of deeper nested sub-domains. A solitary `*` implies a match for any RDSID across all domain authorities. Presently, the use of this wildcard is subject to certain rules: there can only be one asterisk used, it has to be the concluding character, and it needs to align with a segment boundary to avoid partial matches of segment names, necessitating that the asterisk either follows a period directly or stands alone to represent a universal match.

## Examples
### Syntactically valid RDSIDs:
```ts
org.thing.fooBar
com.buyer.alice
a-0.b-1.g
x.y.z
```

### Syntactically Invalid RDSIDs:
```ts
org.exaðŸ’©ple.thing // invalid ASCII rule
org.thing // minimum of three parts validation failure
```
