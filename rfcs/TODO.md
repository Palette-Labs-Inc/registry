### TODO
- [ ] users must reference a specific node as their host in the `Agent Registry` contract. This will replace the DID document format that bluesky has.
- [ ] Need some help with E2EE methods, currently repos are public and nosh-protocol content (**records**) is stored in per-account repositories (frequently shortened toÂ **repo**). All currently active records are stored in the repository, and current repository contents are publicly available, but both content deletions and account deletions are fully supported.
- write [webAuthN standards](./00010-remote-procedure-calls.md#authentication-webauthn)
