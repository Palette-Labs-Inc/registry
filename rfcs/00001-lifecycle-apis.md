## Abstract
This document proposes an overview of different actors who can work together to build open e-commerce networks across which Providers and their services are universally discoverable from any protocol-enabled application.

## Introduction
We believe there is a generational opportunity to decentralize internet infrastructure for commercial markets. Of all of the possible places that one could focus on, we believe that commercial markets are the largest category with the most disrupt-able incumbents.

Traditionally, platforms capitalize on [network effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect), benefiting Providers and Buyers as their transactions increase. However, the growth of such platforms often leads to high rents due to increased market power. To address this, we propose a decentralized network co-owned by market participants. We introduce algorithms for distributing platform ownership based on the unique contributions of a variety of actors within the network. Our design aims to incentivize Providers to join as co-owners and actively contribute to the platformâ€™s success by marketing it to buyers and recruiting additional Providers. This document defines the different actors within the network, and their unique roles.  

## Motivation
The building blocks for commercial markets should exist outside of private companies as public digital infrastructure, like the Internet itself. An open, decentralized protocol for commercial markets gives Buyers and Providers a choice in their experience, Providers control over their relationships with Buyers, and developers the freedom to innovate without requiring access from any authority. 

By removing entry requirements, the network allows for independent actors to introduce local optimizations, taking advantage of societies collective cognitive surplus to fill economic gaps in markets.

### Network Participants

#### Buyer
An individual with a need to purchase a product or service at a given moment in time. 

#### Provider 
An organization with a Catalog of products or services available for sale. 

#### Buyer Servicing Node (BSN)
`BSNs` build software applications & store Buyer data for the network. BSNs can be managed by individual developers or organizations who intend to offer experiences to consumers but do not care to maintain inventory lists of `Providers`.  

`BSNs` can be managed by individual developers or organizations who intend to offer experiences to consumers. `BSNs` might have a new idea for a new application, like a video-first shopping app, a social-commerce app, or a spatial-computing shopping experience. `BSNs` implement the protocol because it gives them instant access to a network of `Producers`. They can implement the protocol standard and get access to these `Producers` without ever having to formally onboard the `Producer` or communicate with them. 

#### Provider Servicing Node (PSN)
`PSN`s onboard the `Provider` side of the network. PSNs can be managed by a local chamber of commerce, a small business cooperative, individual restaurants or retailers, taxi-networks, big tech companies, etc. The primary role of the `PSN` in the open network is to attain and maintain fresh inventory lists for `Providers` such that when a `Buyer` broadcasts an intent to transact, they can be sure that their request to avail services/products is fulfilled by the `Provider` 

The primary role of the `PSN` is to maintain inventory lists for `Producers` so that when a `Buyer` searches for a service, the `PSN` can respond with a list of `Providers` that are capable of fulfilling the `Buyers` request. `PSNs` can charge a fee for providing tools for `Producers` that help them maintain their inventory and accept more orders. For example a `PSN` might make it easier for `Producers` to manage their inventory via a point-of-sale solution. Some `Producers` may choose to run their own `PSN` instance, although this behavior is unexpected. 

#### Node Operator
A `PSN` or `BSN` providing services to a Buyer or `Provider` within the network, occupying a record in the Registry. 

`BSNs` and `PSNs` are organizations, universities, businesses or any other entity that host user data, like Gmail and Outlook host email. These managed hosts can offer features that would be impractical for users to run independently at scale. They can provide better user experiences, and we should expect most people to use them instead of running their own servers.

### Public Network Infrastructure

#### Gateways
`Gateways` are routing software that route search packets from `BSNs` and index services that help `BSNs` discover relevant `Providers` during a `Buyers` search process.

        Gateway-->>-PSNn: ACK
        Note over Gateway,PSNn: PSN(n) triggers callback w/ Provider list
    end
 ```

#### Registry 
A decentralized public ledger that maintains the records of `Node Operators`, their supported Industry Codes, and the geographical regions that they represent. The registry is queried for a `Providers` products or services by `Gateways` and `Buyer Servicing Nodes` during the search phase of a `Buyers` transaction lifecycle 

During the server-to-server communication node's are expected to send a signed digest of the request body using the private key that was used to register their node in the reigistry. When a server recives a new request, it verifies the signature header and message contents by looking up the public key of the signer in the registry and verifying the signature.

    REGISTRY->>PSN_VS: request
    Note over PSN_VS: PSN verifies BSN signature
    PSN_VS-->>PSN: response
    Note over PSN: PSN processes request
```

## Service Modules
Modern platforms use sophisticated services for: search and discovery, personalized recommendations, routing and logistics, fraud detection, dynamic pricing, and more. 

**Examples**:
-  a routing or logistics service could inform which drivers are returned by a `PSN` when a `Buyer` searches for a mobility or rideshare service.  
- a recommendation service could inform which `Providers` are returned by the network when a `Buyer` searches for a book written by a specific author. 

Independent parties can write `Service Modules` for various computational needs and sell them to `Node Operators`.  There should be ways for services to be discovered by `Node Operators` and used at any point during the transaction lifecycle. A network token can function as a micro-payments layer to facilitate the exchange of services. It also introduces a novel business model for publishing algorithms that provide utility for the network. This approach enables the development of a diverse range of services, enhancing the network's possibilities. 

Independent third parties should be able to list their services in a publicly discoverable registry. Their services should be computationally verifiable and self-authenticating. This could be designed similarly to [custom feeds](https://github.com/bluesky-social/feed-generator) in ATProto (Bsky).

    Note over PSN,ServiceModule: PSN requests a service from the module

## Commercial Transaction Lifecycle Overview
All commercial transactions in any two-sided market can be represented by a series of interactions between a `Buyer` and a `Provider` over the life of a `Buyer`'s transaction. The network design establishes these interactions by a set of standardized APIs.

### Discovery
a `Buyer` broadcasts their intent to avail a service. The network responds with a list of `Providers`

### Shop
a `Buyer` constructs a cart from the items available in the catalogs of the `Provider` list and places an order with a `Provider`

### Fulfill
the order is fulfilled. A `Buyer` can track the status of their order.

### Post-Fulfill
a `Buyer` can review or request support for their order in the case that they are dissatisfied.

The network's core working groups and community will work on and publish standards for each API with unique schema definitions tailored to the specific service types for a variety of industries. All APIs are implemented as a series of signed, asynchronous POST requests between `Node Operators`.  

## Discovery APIs (search, on_search)

2. **Client Application:** Sends the search query to the `BSN`.

3. **BSN (Before API Processing):** 
   - Prepares a search packet with the query "pizza".
   - Forwards this packet to the `Gateway Provider` using the `POST /search` method, targeting the `Gateway Provider's` callback URL as registered.

4. **Gateway Provider (Broadcasting):** 
   - Receives the search query and broadcasts it to all relevant `PSN`s (Provider Servicing Nodes) that match the search criteria, ensuring a wide net is cast for Providers offering "pizza" in the appropriate geographical areas.

5. **PSN (Provider Servicing Node):** 
   - Each `PSN` processes the search query and compiles a list of Providers that meet the search criteria.
   - Responds to the `Gateway Provider` with their respective lists using the `POST /on_search` method, directed at the `Gateway Provider's` callback URL.

6. **Gateway Provider (Aggregating Responses):** 
   - Aggregates all responses from the `PSN`s into a comprehensive list of Providers.
   - Forwards this aggregated list back to the `BSN` using the `POST /on_search` method, ensuring the `BSN` receives a complete set of options to present to Alice.

7. **BSN (After API Processing):** 
   - Receives the aggregated list of Providers from the `Gateway Provider`.
   - Processes and compiles the information, preparing it for delivery to Alice's Client Application.

8. **Client Application:** 
   - Retrieves the compiled list of Providers from the `BSN`.

### Cancel, OnCancel

1. **Client Application:** Alice asks to cancel her order.

2. **Client Application:** Initiates the cancellation process by sending a request to the `BSN`.

3. **BSN (Before API Processing):** 
   - Prepares a cancellation request by packaging Alice's order ID and sending it to the appropriate `PSN` using the `POST /cancel` method on the `PSN's` callback URL, as found in the registry.

4. **PSN (Provider Servicing Node):** 
   - Receives the cancellation request and processes it. Confirms the cancellation by using the `POST /on_cancel` method, sending a confirmation back to the `BSN` through its callback URL.

5. **BSN (After API Processing):** 
   - Upon receiving confirmation of the cancellation from the `PSN`, the `BSN` updates its records to reflect the cancellation and prepares to notify Alice's client application.

6. **BSN (Communicating to Client Application):** 
   - Sends the cancellation confirmation to Alice's Client Application, ensuring Alice is informed of the order's cancellation status.

7. **Client Application:** 
   - Receives the cancellation confirmation from the `BSN`.
   - Updates the UI to inform Alice that her order has been successfully canceled, closing the loop on the cancellation request.

### OnCancel - triggered by Provider

1. **Bob's App:** Bob decides to cancel the order.

2. **Bob's App:** Initiates the cancellation by sending a cancellation request to the `PSN`.

3. **PSN (Provider Servicing Node):** 
   - Receives the cancellation request from Bob's App and processes the request.
   - Uses the `POST /on_cancel` method to forward the cancellation request to the `BSN`, indicating the desire to cancel the order.

4. **BSN (Before API Processing):** 
   - Acknowledges receipt of the cancellation request from PSN with an ACK (Acknowledgement) response.
   - Prepares to inform Alice's Client Application about the cancellation.

5. **BSN (After API Processing):** 
   - Forwards the cancellation confirmation to Alice's Client Application through a websocket connection using the `ws:/cancel` endpoint, ensuring real-time notification.

6. **Client Application:** 
   - Receives the cancellation confirmation from `BSN`.
   - Updates the order status to reflect the cancellation to Alice, ensuring she is informed of the cancellation made by Bob.

## Post-Fulfillment APIs (support, on_support)

### Support, OnSupport

1. **Alice's Client Application:** Alice identifies an issue with her order and decides to request support.

2. **Alice's Client Application:** Initiates the support request by sending a support query to the `BSN`.

3. **BSN (Buyer Servicing Node):** 
   - Receives Alice's request for support and processes it.
   - Sends a `POST /support` request to the `PSN`, including details of Alice's order and the specific support requested.

4. **PSN (Provider Servicing Node):** 
   - Acknowledges the receipt of the support request from the BSN with an ACK (Acknowledgement) response.
   - Assesses the request and compiles the necessary support details.

5. **PSN (Provider Servicing Node):** 
   - Sends the compiled support details back to the BSN using the `POST /on_support` method.

6. **BSN (Buyer Servicing Node):** 
   - Receives the support details from the PSN and prepares the information for Alice's Client Application.

7. **BSN (Buyer Servicing Node):** 
   - Forwards the detailed support response to Alice's Client Application using the `api/on_support` response endpoint.

8. **Alice's Client Application:** 
   - Receives the support response from the BSN.
   - Updates the interface to present the support information to Alice, ensuring she receives the help requested for her order.
